--- # Bundler - here separeately as it needs to load after the rbenv role.

- name: install bundler
  # This needs to be run inside a bash shell to initialise rbenv, might be doable with shell command somehow...
  # See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22115936/install-bundler-gem-using-ansible for more info.
  # Alternately rbenv could be set in environment variables somehow?
  command: bash -lc "gem install bundler  --no-ri --no-rdoc"

- name: reload rbenv
  command: bash -lc "rbenv rehash"
